# Show Me the Data Structures

This is a group of 6 data structures problems. Each is contained in one of
the sub directories. Each problem directory contains:

* A description.md file, which is a copy of the problem description
* One or more python files which implement the solution
* A solution.md file, which provides a description of the solution design and
runtime behavior

| Problem | Directory | Solution Files |
|--------|------------| ---------------|
| Problem 1: LRU Cache | lru-cache | linked_list.py, lru_cache.py |
| Problem 2: File Recursion | find-files | find_files.py |
| Problem 3: Huffman Coding | huffman | huffman.py |
| Problem 4: Active Directory | active-directory | active_directory.py |
| Problem 5: Blockchain | blockchain | blockchain.py |
| Problem 6: Union and Intersection | set | list_set.py |

All solutions will run their test code when run as `__main__`.
