# # Stock Prices

# You are given access to yesterday's stock prices for a single stock. The data is in the form of an array with the stock price in 30 minute intervals from 9:30 a.m EST opening to 4:00 p.m EST closing time. With this data, write a function that returns the maximum profit obtainable. You will need to buy before you can sell.
# 
# For example, suppose you have the following prices:
# 
# `prices = [3, 4, 7, 8, 6]`
# 
# >Note: This is a shortened array, just for the sake of exampleâ€”a full set of prices for the day would have 13 elements (one price for each 30 minute interval betwen 9:30 and 4:00), as seen in the test cases further down in this notebook.
# 
# In order to get the maximum profit in this example, you would want to buy at a price of 3 and sell at a price of 8 to yield a maximum profit of 5. In other words, you are looking for the greatest possible difference between two numbers in the array.
# 
# Fill out the function below and run it against the test cases. Take into consideration the time complexity of your solution.
