This is a group of 7 problems based on the algorithms lessons. Each problem
directory contains:

* A description.md file, which is a copy of the problem description
* One or more python files which implement the solution
* A solution.md file, which provides a description of the solution design and
runtime behavior

| Problem | Directory | Solution Files |
|--------|------------| ---------------|
| Square Root of an Integer | square-root | square-root.py |
| Search in a Rotated Sorted Array | rotated | rotated.py |

All solutions will run their test code when run as `__main__`.
